Recently, I decided to repurpose my dad's old MacBook Pro (2015). macOS was struggling to keep up, so I turned to Linux. What followed was a journey through eight Linux distributions, countless lessons, 1.5 weeks of effort, and an unconventional installation process—all without a USB stick.

## MacBook Specifications

- **Model:** `MacBook11,5`
- **WiFi Card:** `BCM43602`
- **CPU:** Intel Core i7-4870HQ CPU @ 2.50GHz
- **Graphics:** AMD Radeon R9 M370X (Discrete)

> **Note:** What I did for my MacBook Pro may not work for yours.

## Why Linux?

The MacBook Pro was hella laggy on macOS. So naturally I ended up wanting to install Linux. A quick  search for "arch linux dual boot macos" led me to the Arch Linux Wiki's [Mac](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Mac) and [Laptop/Apple](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Laptop/Apple) pages. My goal: install Arch Linux and dual boot it alongside macOS. The catch? I didn’t have a USB stick to install the ISO.

## Installation Without a USB Stick

### Attempt 1: Virtual Machine Approach

*Inspired* by ChatGPT, I tried installing Arch Linux in a virtual machine (VM) and extracting it into a partition. However, extracting the VM installation to the MacBook proved too complex and ultimately unsuccessful.

### Attempt 2: Booting from a Partition

After asking being "inspired" by ChatGPT, I came across [rEFInd](https://www.rodsbooks.com/refind/); a boot manager with macOS support. This led to my first attempt:

1. Installed rEFInd using `./refind-install.sh`.
2. Created two new partitions:
    - **ISO Partition:** 8GB, formatted as FAT32.
    - **Archintosh HD:** 192GB, intended for the Linux installation.
3. Booted into the ISO partition to start the installation process.

#### The “No Space Left on Device” Error

During installation, `pacstrap` failed because the EFI partition ran out of space. Out of desperation, I deleted rEFInd thinking it was the culprit. It wasn’t.

## Exploration Arc: Trying Other Distros

When Arch didn’t work out initially, I explored other Linux distributions. Here’s what I had to deal with:

1. **Linux Mint (Cinnamon):** Severe performance issues.
2. **Manjaro Linux:** Failed to boot, likely due to conflicts with the macOS partition.
3. **ArcoLinux and EndeavourOS:** WiFi issues caused by the default `broadcom-wl` driver instead of `brcmfmac` (I didn’t realize this at the time).
4. **Debian:** The ISO froze on boot. Fixed by replacing the `grubx64.efi` file with the version from the testing ISO ([source](https://forums.debian.net/viewtopic.php?t=155747)), but I found Debian too rigid compared to Arch.

## Returning to Arch Linux

### Step 1: Booting from a Partition (Again)

This time, I skipped rEFInd and used macOS’s built-in `bless` command:

```sh
sudo bless --device /dev/diskXsY --set-boot
```

At boot, I held the Alt key to select the ISO partition, and it worked.

### Step 2: Fixing the EFI Mount Point

Previously, I mounted the EFI partition to `/boot` as per the [Arch Linux installation guide](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Installation_guide). This time, I mounted it to `/boot/efi`, resolving the “No Space Left on Device” error. I learned this from Debian’s partition structure.

### Step 3: Resolving WiFi Issues

Post-installation, I spent hours debugging WiFi issues:

1. Replaced the `broadcom-wl` driver with `brcmfmac`.
2. Addressed a bug in `wpa_supplicant` v2.11 ([source](https://forum.endeavouros.com/t/pinebook-cannot-connect-to-wifi-anymore/58516)) by switching NetworkManager’s backend to `iwd`.

Finally, the WiFi worked, allowing me to proceed with post-installation configurations.

### Step 4: Setting up webcam drivers

For webcam drivers, I used [`facetimehd`](https://github.com/patjak/facetimehd) followed the instructions in the wiki and it worked first try!

## Lessons Learned

1. **Partitioning Matters:** Correct EFI mount points are crucial.
2. **Driver Awareness:** Knowing the right WiFi driver (`brcmfmac` in this case) saved hours.
3. **Persistence Pays Off:** Linux on a MacBook can be challenging, but the performance gains are worth it.

With Arch Linux up and running, the 2015 MacBook Pro now meets my requirements for a laptop. If you’re looking to repurpose an old computer, just install Linux.
