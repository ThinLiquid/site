title: Why I uninstalled Arch Linux

Recently, I installed Arch Linux on a 2015 MacBook Pro. While the novelty of running Arch on a MacBook was nice, it wasn’t exactly practical, to say the least.

## Package Issues

One day, I decided to update all my packages. Before I knew it, I rebooted to a black screen. I ended up wasting five hours troubleshooting, only to realize the issue was caused by a faulty Hyprland plugin that hadn’t been updated for the new Hyprland version.

## Hyprland Being Hyprland

Due to the nature of Hyprland, I sank hours into just getting it to function like a normal desktop environment. I couldn’t do anything without falling into a cycle of ricing or installing yet another package. Every time I fixed one thing, I found myself tweaking something else. It was like an endless rabbit hole of configuration, and while that’s fun for some, it wasn’t what I wanted from my daily driver.

## MacBook Hell

Running Arch Linux on a MacBook is far from ideal. Since it’s not the most "*well-supported*" platform, troubleshooting issues meant relying on outdated forum threads and wiki pages. macOS-specific hardware quirks, like power management, audio, and WiFi, all had their own unique problems that weren’t straightforward to fix. Sure, I got everything *mostly* working, but it always felt like a fragile setup, ready to break with the next update.

## Switching Back to macOS

After switching back to macOS, I immediately noticed a massive performance boost. For reference, osu!(lazer) on the OpenGL renderer used to run at around 45 FPS (fluctuating up to 60 FPS) on macOS before installing Arch. Post-Arch, it stabilized at 60 FPS. But after switching back to macOS, I was getting 70 FPS in-game and around 100 FPS in menus. That’s when I realized-maybe macOS isn’t so bad after all.

And it wasn’t just osu!. The entire system felt smoother. Video playback, animations, even general responsiveness-everything was just better. It made me appreciate how well Apple optimizes their software for their hardware. I had spent so much time trying to make Arch *usable* when macOS was already polished out of the box.

## Losses

Of course, switching back wasn’t all smooth sailing. There were some trade-offs:

- **Steam Proton is gone** - This one doesn't even need an explanation.
- **No more AUR** - If you’ve ever used the AUR (Arch User Repository), you know how powerful it is. Having access to thousands of community-maintained packages with a single command is something I miss. `brew` just doesn’t compare-it’s slower, clunkier, and lacks the same variety of software.
- **No tiling window managers:** I got used to the workflow of a tiling WM like Hyprland, and macOS’s tiling solutions (like yabai) just aren’t the same. Managing windows efficiently requires more effort now.

## Afterword

At the end of the day, Arch Linux is a great OS, but it wasn’t the right choice for this machine. If I were running it on a desktop or a well-supported laptop, I might still be using it. But on a MacBook, it was just too much of a headache.

macOS may not have the raw flexibility of Linux, but it *works*. I don’t have to worry about updates breaking my system, my battery life is better, and everything is just smooth. Sure, I miss some aspects of Arch, but I’ve come to appreciate the stability and optimization that macOS provides. Sometimes, it’s better to have an OS that *just works* rather than one that constantly needs fixing.

Would I use Arch again? Probably (but not on a MacBook), however it did make for a good experience (debugging and installation wise), and also a better understanding of how bootloaders, and computers work in general. I might also make another webOS in the future!!
