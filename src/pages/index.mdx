# welcome to thinliquid's [studio]

hiya, I'm ThinLiquid, a 15-year-old ~~TypeScript enthusiast~~ **developer** from the UK. I like building
tools to solve personal challenges and/or exploring new frameworks, I'm always *usually* working on one
thing or the other!

I specialize in web technologies like [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), which I love for
its flexibility and type safety. I also work extensively with [Astro](https://astro.build/) and
[Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) aswell!

Currently, I'm learning **Rust**, **Swift**, and **Flutter (Dart)**.

When I'm not writing code, I'm playing osu!mania, making pixel art, or listening to music!
