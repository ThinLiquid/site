Since I've started **thinliquid's \[studio\]**, this is one of the biggest
refreshes I've done on my site since.

One day, I impulsively purchased the **milktea.coffee** domain (whilst drinking
[Russian Breakfast Tea](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01BPPDGTK)), from there I
didn't know what I was going to do with the domain... so I decided I would turn
it into my blog domain. Lucky for me, tea is a liquid.

The purchase of the domain caused me to restructure my entire site so I could
have it as a monorepo (which is probably going to be an issue in the future),
and I eventually ended up making a whole new layout in the process.

And, here we are now!
